# Data Science Portfolio

A curated portfolio documenting the evolution of my data science thinking, from descriptive analysis to statistical inference and causal reasoning.

### Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate not only technical proficiency,
but also disciplined analytical thinking, awareness of model limitations,
and iterative refinement of methodology.
